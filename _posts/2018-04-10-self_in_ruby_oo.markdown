Ruby OO really through me for a loop (*does drum motions*). I thought methods working with one another was complicated and then came classes. One thing inparticular that took me the longest time to grasp was self. Understanding self is crucial and I thought maybe I could get by without fully understanding it, I was wrong. Self continues to grow as being a vital component of Ruby the further along I go. 

So how did I learn self? I watched about 10 hours of youtube videos in one day. The next day I read a lot of code online (google) that involved self. The third day I started coding it myself. After a week or two of working with self I now feel like I understand it, especially it's importance of communicating with other classes and modules.
