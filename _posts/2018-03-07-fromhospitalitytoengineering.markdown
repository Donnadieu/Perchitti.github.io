One of my greatest strengths is my social skill set, which helped immensely as I have supported myself much of my life. I quickly found myself working in restaurants, making great money but feeling very stagnant and bored. My friends suggested I take a course at the local art college, which got my wheels turning. I ended up in a coding course, incredibly nervous. My teacher and my classmates made the experience incredibly engaging for me and I passed with flying colors. I finally found something I wanted to pursue. 

Unfortunately, after the intro course, I struggled to find work and so my survival-mind quickly resumed and I returned to hospitality. It was only a matter of time before the feelings of unfulfillment resumed, and so I decided to move to New York City. At the time of my move I had as many connections as I had friends, zero. 

Fast forward to a couple years later, I am steadily on my feet in corporate catering for tech companies. I had made it one step closer to the engineering work I'm looking to get into, and my wheels began to turn again: I needed to freshen up my skills. 

I've decided, this time on my own terms, to pursue something that no one can ever take away from me, furthering my education. Engineering is depandable and flexible, just like the career I hope to hold one day.
